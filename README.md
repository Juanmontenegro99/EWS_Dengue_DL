# Early warning system for dengue with deep learning
Dengue is one of the vector-borne diseases with the highest incidence in the world. Specifically, in Colombia, there are more than X cases and X deaths per year, making the prevention of this disease a priority for public health policies in the country.

This project seeks to create an early warning system for possible epidemics that may occur in the country based on a deep learning model that is informed by Google search trends of the different symptoms and keywords related to the disease and the cases confirmed by the Public Surveillance System (SIVIGILA). All the data used in this project is public and has no conflicts of interest; however, due to the size of the databases, they are not in this repository.

This project in development is my master's thesis in biomedical engineering that should be defended in December 2023 and hopes to have the scope of a binary system of accurate and reliable alerts on the increase of dengue cases in the country as a support in the decision-making of public health policies.

The developed code shows the processing and adjustment of the data used and the preliminary results of the first models proposed for this problem.
